# On My Watch Readme

# CONTRIBUTORS:

This project was developed by backend developers Amanda McMullin and John Parrish and frontend developers Susan Brown and Connor O'Mara.

# DESCRIPTION:

On My Watch is an app designed for the user who is looking for new ideas or inspiration for what to watch next.  We've all been there, having finished watching a great movie or TV series and wondering, "What's next?"  This app allows users to browse recommendations by others, follow users to keep up with their latest recommendations, add shows they're interested in to a personal watch list, search, comment on shows, and make their own recommendations.  It also employs sentiment analysis to gauge the overall emotion of the recommendation and color-codes the card appropriately.
